Numerical analysis of vaccination strategies

In this work, it will be presented and analyzed a model that contains two vaccination strategies: a constant vaccination, wherein a certain parcel of the population that is born is immediately vaccinated; and vaccination in pulses, wherein a certain parcel of the population is vaccinated periodically. It is proposed the utilization of a function that illustrates the vaccination in pulses behaviour. An implementation of the parameters variation study is performed. Finally, epidemiological scenarios wherein both strategies are alternately inserted in the same population and scenarios wherein only one of them is applied are numerically compared and discussed.
